# How to Use the Water Bill Split App

This guide explains what to enter when a new HSY bill arrives and how to handle
corrections.

## When a new HSY bill arrives

1. Open the HSY bill and note:
   - Billing period start and end dates
   - Invoice number (laskun numero)
   - Estimated water amount on the bill
   - Due date (erapaiva)
   - Basic fees total (perusmaksu)
   - Consumption total (kayttomaksut)
2. Use the sub-meter readings for the period:
   - AS-1 (Ameen) and AS-2 (Jussi)
   - One reading serves as both END of one period and START of the next.
   - So you only need 4 visits to the maintenance room per year.
   - Both Ameen and Jussi go together to take photos of both sub-meters.
3. Open the app and go to **Split current bill**.
4. Enter the billing period dates.
5. Enter invoice number, estimated water, and due date.
6. Enter basic fees and consumption totals (Total bill shown automatically).
7. Enter sub-meter readings:
   - Choose **Readings (start/end)** if you have both start and end values, or
   - Choose **Usage only** if you only know the usage.
8. Optional: enter main meter readings (whole numbers) to see mismatch status.
9. Click **Calculate split** and review the totals and settlement.
10. Copy the WhatsApp line to send the payment summary.
11. Keep **Save this period to history** checked for future reference.

## HSY billing periods (4 times per year)

- 01/01 - 31/03 (Q1)
- 01/04 - 30/06 (Q2)
- 01/07 - 30/09 (Q3)
- 01/10 - 31/12 (Q4)

## 2026 reading dates (maintenance room visits)

Go to the maintenance room on these dates (4 times per year):

- 31/03/2026 - End of Q1, Start of Q2
- 30/06/2026 - End of Q2, Start of Q3
- 30/09/2026 - End of Q3, Start of Q4
- 31/12/2026 - End of Q4, Start of Q1 2027

One reading serves as both the END of one period and the START of the next.

Best times: Late evening (21:00-23:59) on the last day, OR early morning
(06:00-08:00) on the first day of the new period.

## When HSY sends a correction (true-up)

1. Go to **True-up / Reconciliation**.
2. Enter the correction amount (positive for extra charge, negative for credit).
3. Select the periods the correction covers from history, or enter usage manually.
4. Click **Calculate true-up** and settle using the shown shares.

## Mismatch policy (default and override)

- Default is **Ignore mismatch (display-only)** so it does not affect the split.
- You can manually override:
  - **Split mismatch 50/50**
  - **Split mismatch proportional**
- Use overrides only when both parties agree.

## History page

- Shows all saved periods and computed shares.
- Use **Refresh data** button to reload latest from Google Sheets.
- Download as CSV or PDF for your records.
- Cumulative totals show running totals for both parties.
