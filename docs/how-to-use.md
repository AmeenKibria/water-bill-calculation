# How to Use the Water Bill Split App

This guide explains what to enter when a new HSY bill arrives and how to handle
corrections.

## When a new HSY bill arrives

1. Open the HSY bill and note:
   - Billing period start and end dates
   - Basic fees total (perusmaksu)
   - Consumption total (kayttomaksut)
2. Read both sub-meters (AS-1/Ameen and AS-2/Jussi) at the start and end of
   the billing period.
   - Go to the maintenance room and take a photo of both readings.
   - Take the start reading on the first day of the period.
   - Take the end reading on the last day of the period (evening) or the next
     morning before any significant use.
3. Open the app and go to **Split current bill**.
4. Enter the billing period and the two bill totals.
5. Enter sub-meter readings:
   - Choose **Readings (start/end)** if you have both start and end values, or
   - Choose **Usage only** if you only know the usage.
6. Optional: enter main meter readings to see mismatch status.
7. Click **Calculate split** and review the totals and settlement.
8. Copy the WhatsApp line to send the payment summary.
9. Keep **Save this period to history** checked for future true-ups.

## When HSY sends a correction (true-up)

1. Go to **True-up / Reconciliation**.
2. Enter the correction amount (positive for extra charge, negative for credit).
3. Select the periods the correction covers from history, or enter usage manually.
4. Click **Calculate true-up** and settle using the shown shares.

## Mismatch policy (default and override)

- Default is **Ignore mismatch (display-only)** so it does not affect the split.
- You can manually override:
  - **Split mismatch 50/50**
  - **Split mismatch proportional**
- Use overrides only when both parties agree.
